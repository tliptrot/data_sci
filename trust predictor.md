### Introduction


A small group of academics, particularly Heather Roff and Stephen Feldstein, have raised concerns about the political impact of artificial intelligence. Of course these impacts will be diverse, and are not all to be feared. But one large risk has unusually large long-term consequences.
If A.I. becomes a tool for authoritarian upgrading and impedes the transformation of autocracies to democracies it may have large, negative impacts on long term human welfare. One potential mechanism that Roff and Feldstein have raised is that machine learning algorithms, armed with surveilance data and internet-of-things data may reduce the costs of surveilance and repression for authoritarians. Roth ably makes this argument in this article https://duckofminerva.com/2016/03/autonomous-weapons-and-incentives-for-oppression.html . Rather than paraphrase her excellent argument, I will quote from it at lengrth

"Drawing from work on political survival, we might want to follow Bueno de Mesquita et al and agree that we are confident that leaders survive based on how best they maintain a winning coalition and appease their selectorate (Bueno de Mesquita et. al, 1995, 1997, 1999a, 1999b, 2005), particularly when those leaders have access to free resources or foreign aid (Bueno de Mesquita and Smith, 2010). But what might happen when a political leader was able to diminish the importance of the effects of his winning coalition and selectorate? In other words, we might want to claim that appeasing those individuals who put a leader in power and subsequently maintain that leader’s position in power may no longer be necessary if a leader can cheaply and reliably oppress those individuals rather than providing them with goods.

"(...) In most cases, if not all cases to date, one must satisfy (some) people to maintain power.

"Except this may change when one does not need to rely on fickle humans to do one’s bidding.   For when one relies on a system of violence, one must maintain the support of those individuals perpetrating the harm. If one does not need to pay them, provide them with status, goods or the like, then one is not in fear of their dissatisfaction. Indeed, with an AWS, one does not need to worry if it will continually support a policy position or ask for a raise or more rents."

Should we be concerned about this possibility in the near term? Completely replacing the winning coalition with A.I. technology is not plausible currently, given the complexity of tasks that authoritarians must undertake. That capacity may take many years to develop. Nonetheless, Roff's argument, from a political standpoint, is quite compelling. Anecdotally, there is evidence that regimes lavish signficant rewards on their backers in the security apparatus, both intelligence operatives and violence specialists. As Feldstein points out, East Germany incurred considerable economic coasts recruiting 1% of its population into the security apparatus in one way or another (Feldstein, Steven, Artificial Intelligence and Digital Repression: Global Challenges to Governance (April 18, 2019). Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3374575 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3374575). If, at the margin, A.I. can reduce the costs of reppression today it may already impact authoritarian survival.

A.I. may cheapen reppression by selecting targets for surveilance. Both the gathering huge quantities of information about potential dissidents and the processing of this information could be made easier. For information gathering, China is already investing in new surveilance technologies and incentive systems to produce more data through its well-known social-credit system. However, many authoritarian states lack the capacity to employ such sophisticated information gathering tools: they may lack efficient or incentivized bureaucracies, or their citizens may make little use of social media, or cellular internet coverage may itself be low. These states may still benefit from A.I. if they can improve their targeting of potential dissidents with the data they currently have available, primarily information from censuses and interaction with state services. This demonstration examines if applying machine learning algorithms to existing state data can improve the selection of targets for surveilance, and thus marginally decrease the costs of repressions for less tech-savvy authoritarians.

### Data

The data I use comes from two social cohesion surveys of over 2,000 respondents each conducted in countries. For inclusion a survey must
a) Have occured in a state which regularly relies on repression to maintain the regime at the time of the survey. Any state in which power is not routinely transfered through constitutional means and repressive violence has been used against pro-regime-change movements within 10 years of the survey were included.
b) The survey should aslo collect demographic data which is commonly available to state bureaucracies, including ethnic identities, age, citizenship statuses, employment, region of residence, and some measure of interaction with state (service provision, consultation etc.).
c) Include over 2,000 respondents.
d) Be collected by a non-state actor. Citizens of repressive states may have good reasons to be untruthful toward government surveys. Data collected by international NGO's is more likely to provide an accurate measure of social trust.

I have identified a social cohesion survey done by UNDP in Armenia in 2011 that meets these requirments. The data is available for open access online and is completely anonymized. 

### Method

In this demonstration, I use survey data gathered in rural region of an anonymous, middle-income authoritarian state to test the viability of predicting attitudes toward the state from existing administrative data. 

Because this is a form of supervised learning, I need an output variable. For an ambitious autocrat, the most likely output variable is being caught committing a dissident act, like participating in a protest. In the region I sourced this data (Armenia in 2011), anti-government protests happened every few years and were often met with repression. Roles of protest attendees or captured dissidents would be the obvious y-variable for an ambitious autocrat. Fortunately, I lack access to such sensitive information. Instead I use two y variables. One is an opinion survey question "Do you trust the excecutive government". This metric is likely the closest available analogue to ressistance, because surveys on political topics are difficult to conduct in autocracies. The other y-variable is self-reported political activity. Understanding the predictability of both political attitudes and activity seems a good estimator of the predictability of dissident action.

For x-variables, I drop all features from the survey which do not refer to services or government interactions that could be systematically captured by the state. I attempt to remove any opinion data from the survey.

Finally, I compute several heuristics which the state

### Success and Failure Metric

The viability of a machine learning system for dissident targeting is highly dependent on the desired false-positive rate. For any non-deterministic system, like human behavior, no algorithm can have a 100% true positive rate without having a 100% false positive rate as well. In other words, if the authoritarian wants to identify every possible dissident, her algorithm must redutrn all residents. Conversely, if the authoritarian wants to return no false positives, her algorithm must also miss all true positives. So the viability of the algorithm depends on the preferences for false positives and false negatives of the authoritarian.

Speculatively, it may be that the false positive and false negative tolerance is situational. For example, the Omar Al-Bashir during the Darfur crisis was willing to support attacks against Fur civilians which caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. It is possible that because Fur was not vital to his regime as a source of funding or recruits he was willing to tolerate considerable damage and loss of trust in this community. In other contexts, authoritarians may prefer a low false positive rate. The Hashemite monarchy of Jordan has historical relied on the support of rural tribes, particularly to staff its army and repressive apparatus. Repression required forcing older tribespeople in the army to do violence against the younger generation (Yom, Sean L. 2014. “Tribal Politics in Contemporary Jordan: The Case of the Hirak Movement.” The Middle East Journal 68(2): 229–47.). That violence was justified on the basis that the younger protestors had "dishonored" the tribe by violating loyalty norms. In this context, false positives could jeopardise a vital base of regime support.

In response to this variability in false-positive correspondence, I will compare the success of the algorithm to a few heuristic selection mechanisms a regime might employ. For example, the regime might place under surveilance all persons who have not received a government job. These heuristic models provide a base false-positive and false-negative rate to compare with the performance of the algorithm. If the alrogithm signficantly overperforms heuristic selection, then there is good reason to believe that it will reduce the cost of repression.

#### Feature selection.

The data set currenlty has two glaring problems that must be addressed before in-depth feature engineering begins.
a) It has far too many features.
b) It contains information about personal beliefs or life states that states could only (possibly) access through mass digital surveilance combined with NLP or through the surveying of almost all residents. For the no-NLP case, we must drop all of this information.


```python
# First I make a new dataset called dfa (the dataset with no value information, only information the government might get through conventional methods)
# dfa is a deep copy of df, so if by chance I change df, it will not affect dfa.

import copy
dfa = copy.deepcopy(df)

# First, I make a list of columns. I will add each new variable to it when I decide to keep it.
# For now I add two very uncontrovertial values. Gender and region of residence. At the end of
# feature enginee

keepsies = ["gender_R", "MARZ"]
```


```python

```


```python

```


```python

```

##### Education

Several questions contain information about school enrollment. This is a plausible peice of data to gather systematically, so we should draw from it if the respondent has children and if they go to school.


```python
# This line looks at the data before we upload it. If the question had the same response from over
# 90% of respondents, I might not include it because it would contain little information.
df.EDU1.value_counts()
```




    Neither of the above         2349
    I have children in school     819
    Name: EDU1, dtype: int64




```python
#looks like EDU1 tells us if the respondent has children in school, which is useful
dfa["child_in_school"]= dfa.EDU1 == "I have children in school"

keepsies.append("child_in_school")
```

The next survey questions deal with the quality of schools that the respondent uses. EDU2_02 asks is "How serious is each of the following problems at the school, attended by your oldest child/you: Poor material conditions and facilities at school". EDU5_02 asks "How do you asses your children's educational opportunities/yours compared to: the majority of the children in your country."

A government might know about the quality of schools. This is not guaranteed, if tests scores are frequently faked or evaluation of schools is not routinely practiced. Reinikka amd Svenson found in Uganda that the MoF was unaware that 80% of their funding to local schools was being captured by middle men. Wherever the availabity of the data is dependent on state capacity, I assume higher state capacity. It would be trivial to argue that a government with access to only demographic data about its citizens can poorly predict their behavior.

However, perceptional questions about school quality are "leaky" because they tell the algorithms about the persons attitudes as much as about the quality of ther schools. To demonstrate this we can look at the responses to the questionare.


```python
df.EDU5_2.value_counts()
```




    the same      361
    worse         280
    better         90
    Don't know     83
    Name: EDU5_2, dtype: int64



Considerably more respondents answered worse than answered better. That suggests there are attitudes stored in the data, so I do not append it.

##### Employment

Employment statistics are not uncommon, and any country with unemployment insurance is likely to have detailed information. Although for autocrats with very large informal sectors, this information would have a different meaning. EMP1 asks "are you employed"and EMP2 asks "are you registered with employment services". The first question includes the informal sector, so it cannot be included.


```python
df.EMP2.value_counts()
```




    No                                   2013

    Yes, in another capacity               57
    Refused                                 1
    Name: EMP2, dtype: int64




```python
#both look goodm but there are too few people in each category. Instead I place both of Yes in the same category.

d = {'Yes, as a person looking for work': True, 'Yes, in another capacity': True}
dfa["emp_serv"] = dfa['EMP2'].map(d)
dfa.emp_serv.value_counts()
keepsies.append("emp_serv")
```


```python
#Similarly the type of job could be collected from tax information. 
dfa.EMP6.value_counts()
```

If the state supplies pension benefits, they are likely to know who has retired. Some states may know if a woman is a full time homemaker the UK overs exemptions from social security requirements to homemakers, for example. This requires a well functioning social security system, however. Illness or disability benefits would give some information anpit the 4th option, and maternity leave information might be cenrtalized. The rest of the answers relate to the informal sector, so there is no way for the state to know. I lump all of these answers together.


```python
# dfa.replace(["Got tired of searching, thought no work available", "Waiting to start arranged job, business or in agriculture", "Refuse", "Off season in agriculture", "Awaiting reply to earlier enquiries" "Have a temporary/ occasional work", "At work as relative assisting on family farm or business"],"Other")

Question 7 asks about the sector that the person works in. Acquiring data on this question faces similar challenges. I am skepctical that reliable data on this question could be collected, as the global poor tend to have many specializations spanning multiple sectors and change fields frequently /( [Bannerjee and Duflo](https://www.amazon.com/Poor-Economics-Radical-Rethinking-Poverty/dp/1610390938) \) . Instead I include the sector only as a boolean value for "Government, Public Administration and Defense, Law Enforcement" or not.

##### Participation

Questions ISNI16_1:5 ask if the respondent has contacted an official, including mayors, Avagani, Marzpetaran, MPs, and central government officials. Let's imagine that the government has an extremely centralized and well attended system of monitoring complaints (again, only possible through great effort).


```python

Oh my, it looks like almost no one contacts the government for anything. That means we can mostly through this information away. I will keep only the mayors question, as the others have two few contacotrs.

Question ISN17 asks "Did you vote in the last parliamentarian/national election"

Some authoritarian systems do closely monitor voting, although it can be difficult. Some of the methods for doing so are ingenious. Until recent electoral changes, Lebanese voters did not receive the names of candidates on their ballots. Instead, they had to receive a pre-printed ballot from the local zu'ama and bring it to the booth. The ballots were printed in bright unique colors like pink or green so that your za'eem (singular of zu'ama) could monitor your voting behavior. While most systems may lack this information.


```python
dfa.ISN17.value_counts()
```

##### Demographic 

Finally, there are a few demographic questions of interest. DEM3 asks about education of the respondent. DEM4 asks about childs enrollment in school.


```python
# DEM3_09 asks about masters degrees. As you can see the distribution of advanced degrees
dfa.DEM3_01.value_counts(dropna = False)
```

    female    1036
    0.0          1
    Name: DEM3_01, dtype: int64




```python
#unfortunately, this data has a very strange format. The gender of the respondent is encoded if they have that level of education. Otherwise a null value is given.
#First I convert all of these values to false if null and true if not-null
for i in range(14):
    dfa.iloc[:,496+i] = ~df.iloc[:,496+i].isnull()
```


```python
#Now I assign 5 values to different education levels. I do not assign separate values for all levels
# such as vocational vs. secondary and phd vs. masters. This would be too much detail.
dfa = dfa.assign(primary_educ=lambda x: x.DEM3_02,
              basic_educ=lambda x: x.DEM3_03,
               secondary_educ=lambda x: x.DEM3_05,
              university_educ=lambda x: x.DEM3_07,
              masters_educ=lambda x: x.DEM3_08)

Question QL10 tells us about the income sources of the household. For some states, this information is highly available and frequently maintained (think about your tax filings, if you live in the west). In less-developed polities, the tax system often does not affect alrge groups of the population, potentially the majority of households. For example, Jordan's income tax contains an exemption of up to 13k\\$ for a single person household, while gdp per capita is only 4k\\$ \( [pwc](http://taxsummaries.pwc.com/ID/Jordan-Individual-Taxes-on-personal-income) ). So most people need pay no taxes or pay only through their employer. The detailed tax data and asset ownership data found in the west is unusual in autocracies. 

In keeping with my generous assumptions about data collection, I assume that some revenue sources are recorded. These include "earned income (salary)", "pensions and government benefits", and "interest or earnings on deposits or securities", and dropping remittances \( [world bank blog](https://blogs.worldbank.org/peoplemove/why-taxing-remittances-bad-idea) \) and other informal sources of income.


```python
#First, I notice that the dat has two many collumns. Refusing to answer questions is certainly leaky, we only want what the government would have. That information is a boolean, because there is a tax record of earning interest or there is no tax record
df.QL10_5.value_counts()
```

for i in range(9):
    dfa.iloc[:,123+i] = dfa.iloc[:,123+i] == "Received"    
#this adds the keeping columns to keepsies. QL10_8 has too few positive respondents (few people receive interest), so it is dropped
#keepsies = keepsies + ["QL10_4", "QL10_5"]
```


```python
dfa["pension_ben"]= dfa.QL10_5
keepsies.append("pension_ben")

### Target feature selection

For the target features, I chose two survey questions. Question C_13_7 asks "Overall how much do you trust the President". In 2011 Serzh Sargasyan was the president of Armenia and was the most visible national symbol of the ruling republican party (Iskandaryan, Alexander. 2018. “The Velvet Revolution in Armenia: How to Lose Power in Two Weeks.” : 19.
). Negative attitudes toward the head of state are plausible targets for future A.I. surveilance programs, so I adopt it as the target variable.

There are important differences between Armenia's regime in 2011 and the current regimes experimenting with A.I. augmented repression, most prominently China. The Sargasyan regime was "generally moderate" in that "persecutions of political opponents were few and never large-scale; bribery and co-optation replaced electoral fraud as the main methods for winning electiosn (...) Political opposition, though weak, was allowed to exist (...)." (Ibid, p. 471). While the Republican Party did sometimes respond to post-election protests with violence, it did not repress all opposition activity. There was no ongoing project to target and repress potential revolutionaries. The different degrees of repression may compromise the generalizability of this exercise.


```python
#From this output, you can see that the respondents were close to evenly split between distrust and trust towar Sargasyan. This makes the prediction lesss complicated because it represents a balanced class.
dfa.C13_07.value_counts()
```

dfa = pd.get_dummies(dfa, drop_first=True)
```


```python

##### Baseline Model

As a rudimentary standard for comparison, I use sklearn's dummy classifier. Using the stratified strategy, it generates random predictions by respecting the training set class distribution, described in [sklearn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier.html).


```python
# from sklearn.dummy import DummyClassifier
# bm = DummyClassifier(strategy="stratified")
# bm.fit(X_train,y_train)
# bm.score(X_test,y_test)
```

##### K-Fold cross-validation

This next block of code performs K-fold cross-validation to identify the most effective model. First, I recombine the X and y data. Then I import several machine learning algorithms from sklearn. I use the KFold functions to iteratively split the data set and test new models, and print some statistics to evaluate each model.


```python
# #This combines the train and test sets together, because the KFold function will split them later. Splitting the data with the KFold function solves the problem of having mdoels that appear to be best only because of the particular split that was applied.
# X = pd.concat(X_train, X_test)
# y = pd.concat(y_train, y_test)
```
